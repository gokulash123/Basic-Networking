      <h3><b>What is Basic Networking?</b></h3>
    </div>
	 <div class="w3-container">
      <p>This document covers the basics of how networking works, and how to use different devices to build networks. Computer networking has existed for many years, and as time has passed the technologies have become faster and less expensive. Networks are made up of various devices—computers, switches, routers—connected together by cables or wireless signals. Understanding the basics of how networks are put together is an important step in building a wireless network in a community or neighborhood.<br><br>

      <h3><b>Why we need Networking?</b></h3>
    </div>
	 <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Computer networks help users on the network to share resources and in communicate. Can you imagine a world now without emails, online newspapers, blogs, chat and the other services offered by the internet?

The following are the important uses and benefits of a computer network.<br>

		<b>1. File sharing: Networking of computers helps the network users to share data files.<br>
		2. Hardware sharing: Users can share devices such as printers, scanners, CD-ROM drives, hard drives etc. Without computer networks, device sharing is not possible.<br>
		3. Application sharing: Applications can be shared over the network, and this allows to implement client/server applications<br>
		4. User communication: Networks allow users to communicate using e-mail, newsgroups, and video conferencing etc.<br>
		5. Network gaming: A lot of network games are available, which allow multi-users to play from different locations.
		6. Voice over IP (VoIP): Voice over Internet Protocol (IP) is a revolutionary change in telecommunication which allows to send telephone calls (voice data) using standard Internet Protocol (IP) rather than by traditional PSTN.</b><br><br>

      <h3><b>What is IP Address?</b></h3>
    </div>
	 <div class="w3-container">
	<img src="ipaddrs.jpg" width="300" height="150" class="w3-hover-sepia">
      <p>An IP address is a unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a local network. IP stands for "Internet Protocol," which is the set of rules governing the format of data sent via the internet or local network.<br>

In essence, IP addresses are the identifier that allows information to be sent between devices on a network: they contain location information and make devices accessible for communication. The internet needs a way to differentiate between different computers, routers, and websites. IP addresses provide a way of doing so and form an essential part of how the internet works.<br><br>
Types of IP Address:<br><br>
<b>
	There are different categories of IP addresses, and within each category, different types.<br></b><br>

<b>1.Common IP address</b><br>
Every individual or business with an internet service plan will have two types of IP addresses: their private IP addresses and their public IP address. The terms public and private relate to the network location — that is, a private IP address is used inside a network, while a public one is used outside a network.<br><br>

<b>2.Private IP address</b><br>
Every device that connects to your internet network has a private IP address. This includes computers, smartphones, and tablets but also any Bluetooth-enabled devices like speakers, printers, or smart TVs. With the growing internet of things, the number of private IP addresses you have at home is probably growing. Your router needs a way to identify these items separately, and many items need a way to recognize each other. Therefore, your router generates private IP addresses that are unique identifiers for each device that differentiate them on the network.<br><br>

<b>3.Public IP address</b><br>
A public IP address is the primary address associated with your whole network. While each connected device has its own IP address, they are also included within the main IP address for your network. As described above, your public IP address is provided to your router by your ISP. Typically, ISPs have a large pool of IP addresses that they distribute to their customers. Your public IP address is the address that all the devices outside your internet network will use to recognize your network.<br><br><br>
