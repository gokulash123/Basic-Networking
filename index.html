      <h3><b>What is Basic Networking?</b></h3>
    </div>
	 <div class="w3-container">
      <p>This document covers the basics of how networking works, and how to use different devices to build networks. Computer networking has existed for many years, and as time has passed the technologies have become faster and less expensive. Networks are made up of various devices—computers, switches, routers—connected by cables or wireless signals. Understanding the basics of how networks are put together is an important step in building a wireless network in a community or neighborhood.<br><br>

      <h3><b>Why we need Networking?</b></h3>
    </div>
	 <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Computer networks help users on the network to share resources and in communicate. Can you imagine a world now without emails, online newspapers, blogs, chat, and the other services offered by the internet?

The following are the important uses and benefits of a computer network.<br>

		<b>1. File sharing: Networking of computers helps the network users to share data files.<br>
		2. Hardware sharing: Users can share devices such as printers, scanners, CD-ROM drives, hard drives, etc. Without computer networks, device sharing is not possible.<br>
		3. Application sharing: Applications can be shared over the network, and this allows to implement of client/server applications<br>
		4. User communication: Networks allow users to communicate using e-mail, newsgroups, video conferencing, etc.<br>
		5. Network gaming: A lot of network games are available, which allow multi-users to play from different locations.
		6. Voice over IP (VoIP): Voice over Internet Protocol (IP) is a revolutionary change in telecommunication that allows sending of telephone calls (voice data) using standard Internet Protocol (IP) rather than by traditional PSTN.</b><br><br>

      <h3><b>What is IP Address?</b></h3>
    </div>
	 <div class="w3-container">
	<img src="ip.jpg" width="300" height="150" class="w3-hover-sepia">
      <p>An IP address is a unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a local network. IP stands for "Internet Protocol," which is the set of rules governing the format of data sent via the internet or local network.<br>

In essence, IP addresses are the identifier that allows information to be sent between devices on a network: they contain location information and make devices accessible for communication. The internet needs a way to differentiate between different computers, routers, and websites. IP addresses provide a way of doing so and form an essential part of how the internet works.<br><br>
Types of IP Address:<br><br>
<b>
	There are different categories of IP addresses, and within each category, different types.<br></b><br>

<b>1.Common IP address</b><br>
Every individual or business with an internet service plan will have two types of IP addresses: their private IP addresses and their public IP address. The terms public and private relate to the network location — that is, a private IP address is used inside a network, while a public one is used outside a network.<br><br>

<b>2.Private IP address</b><br>
Every device that connects to your internet network has a private IP address. This includes computers, smartphones, and tablets but also any Bluetooth-enabled devices like speakers, printers, or smart TVs. With the growing internet of things, the number of private IP addresses you have at home is probably growing. Your router needs a way to identify these items separately, and many items need a way to recognize each other. Therefore, your router generates private IP addresses that are unique identifiers for each device that differentiate them on the network.<br><br>

<b>3.Public IP address</b><br>
A public IP address is a primary address associated with your whole network. While each connected device has its IP address, they are also included within the main IP address for your network. As described above, your public IP address is provided to your router by your ISP. Typically, ISPs have a large pool of IP addresses that they distribute to their customers. Your public IP address is the address that all the devices outside your internet network will use to recognize your network.<br><br><br>

	 <div class="w3-container">
	<img src="ip.jpg" width="300" height="150" class="w3-hover-sepia">
      <p>MAC address is the physical address, which uniquely identifies each device on a given network. To make communication between two networked devices, we need two addresses: IP address and MAC address. It is assigned to the NIC (Network Interface card) of each device that can be connected to the internet.<br>

<b>1.</b>It stands for Media Access Control, and is also known as Physical address, hardware address, or BIA (Burned In Address).<br>
<b>2.</b>It is globally unique; it means two devices cannot have the same MAC address. It is represented in a hexadecimal format on each device, such as 00:0a:95:9d:67:16.<br>
<b>3.</b>It is 12-digit, and 48 bits long, out of which the first 24 bits are used for OUI(Organization Unique Identifier), and 24 bits are for NIC/vendor-specific.<br>
<b>4.</b>It works on the data link layer of the OSI model.<br>
<b>5.</b>It is provided by the device's vendor at the time of manufacturing and embedded in its NIC, which ideally cannot be changed.<br>
<b>6.</b>The ARP protocol is used to associate a logical address with a physical or MAC address.<br>
