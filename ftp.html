      <p>Network devices, or networking hardware, are physical devices that are required for communication and interaction between hardware on a computer network.<br><br>
They are : <br><br>
			<b>1.</b> Hub<br>
			<b>2.</b> Switch<br>
			<b>3.</b> Router<br>
			<b>4.</b> Bridge<br>
			<b>5.</b> Gateway<br>

      <p>In data communication terminology, a transmission medium is a physical path between the transmitter and the receiver i.e. it is the channel through which data is sent from one place to another. Transmission Media is broadly classified into the following types:  <br><br>
They are : <br><br>
			<b>1.</b> Twisted Pair Cable<br>
				<p>It consists of 2 separately insulated conductor wires wound about each other. Generally, several such pairs are bundled together in a protective sheath. They are the most widely used Transmission Media. Twisted Pair is of two types: <br><br>
						<b>i.Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) </b><br>
						<b>ii.Shielded Twisted Pair (STP) </b><br><br>
			<b>2.</b> Coaxial Cable<br><br>
			<b>3.</b> Optical Fiber Cable<br>

	  <h3><b>1. Firewall</b></h3><text-align: center>

      <p>A Firewall is a network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organization’s previously established security policies. At its most basic, a firewall is essentially the barrier that sits between a private internal network and the public Internet. A firewall’s main purpose is to allow non-threatening traffic in and to keep dangerous traffic out.  <br><br>
	<h3>Types of Firewalls</h3><br>
		<b>1. </b>Packet filtering<br>
		   A small amount of data is analyzed and distributed according to the filter’s standards.<br><br>

		<b>2. </b>Proxy service<br>
			The network security system protects while filtering messages at the application layer.<br><br>

		<b>3. </b>Stateful inspection<br>
			Dynamic packet filtering that monitors active connections to determine which network packets to allow through the Firewall.<br><br>

		<b>4. </b>Next Generation Firewall (NGFW)<br>
			Deep packet inspection Firewall with application-level inspection.<br><br><br>
		<h3>What do Firewalls do?</h3><br>
			A Firewall is a necessary part of any security architecture and takes the guesswork out of host-level protections and entrusts them to your network security device. Firewalls, and especially Next Generation Firewalls, focus on blocking malware and application-layer attacks, along with an integrated intrusion prevention system (IPS), these Next Generation Firewalls can react quickly and seamlessly to detect and react to outside attacks across the whole network. They can set policies to better defend your network and carry out quick assessments to detect invasive or suspicious activity, like malware, and shut it down.<br><br>

		<h3>Why do we need firewalls?</h3><br>
			Firewalls, especially Next Generation Firewalls, focus on blocking malware and application-layer attacks. Along with an integrated intrusion prevention system (IPS), these Next Generation Firewalls can react quickly and seamlessly to detect and combat attacks across the whole network. Firewalls can act on previously set policies to better protect your network and can carry out quick assessments to detect invasive or suspicious activity, such as malware, and shut it down. By leveraging a firewall for your security infrastructure, you’re setting up your network with specific policies to allow or block incoming and outgoing traffic.<br><br>

        <h3><b>What is VPN?</b></h3><text-align: center>
	  <text-align: center><img src="vpn.png" width="300" height="150" class="w3-hover-sepia">
	  <p>VPN stands for "Virtual Private Network" and describes the opportunity to establish a protected network connection when using public networks. VPNs encrypt your internet traffic and disguise your online identity. This makes it more difficult for third parties to track your activities online and steal data. The encryption takes place in real-time.</p><br>
    	  <h3><b>How VPN works?</b></h3><br>
		A VPN hides your IP address by letting the network redirect it through a specially configured remote server run by a VPN host. This means that if you surf online with a VPN, the VPN server becomes your data source. This means your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and other third parties cannot see which websites you visit or what data you send and receive online. A VPN works like a filter that turns all your data into "gibberish". It would be useless if someone were to get their hands on your data.<br>
